**Headphone requests**
Headphone requests are not welcome. If the headphones have not been measured by one of the supported sources, AutoEq cannot support it. If you happen to find a frequency response graph for the headphones, you can create eq settings yourself by following [this guide](https://medium.com/@jaakkopasanen/make-your-headphones-sound-supreme-1cbd567832a9). Open a headphone request issue only if the headphones have been measured by one of the supported sources but have not been added to AutoEq.
